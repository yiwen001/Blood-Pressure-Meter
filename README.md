# Blood-Pressure-Meter 

This project is to build a semiautomated blood pressure/HR measuring device. The device is capable of measuring two measurements, mainly Systolic (high number) and Diastolic (low number) where both measurements are in units of mm Hg to accurately represent oneâ€™s blood pressure. Automated systems use pressure transducers to convert pressure data into digital data that algorithm use to calculate the two values, which is oscillometric method.

### Usage


1.press the user button when the screen shows "Press button to start/restart"

2.inflate the cuff to 150 mmHg when the screen shows "Inflate to 150mmHg"                                                      

3.press the user button again when the screen shows "Press to deflate". Make sure the pressure is above 150 mmHg when pressing the button

4.deflate the cuff to 30 mmHg when the screen shows "Deflate to 30 mmHg"

5.All the results will shown on the screen after the deflation,
